# Configured personal MCP accounts

Profile authentication is independent of marketplace membership. Active users
can authorize configured personal connectors; resource rules still govern use.
Enabled servers are listed even when `display_in_web` is false. Servers without
personal authorization show “No authorization required”. Saved accounts remain
disconnectable after a server is removed or disabled.

## Generic OAuth

Add the server YAML to the service aggregator's includes:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  example-tools:
    type: external
    binary: ''
    package: null
    port: 5050
    endpoint: https://mcp.example.com/mcp
    enabled: true
    display_in_web: false
    oauth:
      required: false
      scopes: [user]
      audience: mcp
      client_id: null
    connector:
      adapter: generic
      scopes: [tools:read]
      authorization_origins:
        - https://login.example.com
      # Omit both for dynamic client registration:
      # client_id_secret: example_mcp_client_id
      # client_secret: example_mcp_client_secret
```

The `oauth` block governs inbound access; `connector` configures outbound OAuth.
Core supplies the credential-broker endpoint automatically when `connector` is
set and `external_auth` is absent. Preserve the existing broker secret.

The resource must publish protected-resource metadata identifying its OAuth
authorization server, whose metadata must advertise PKCE S256. The resource
origin is trusted. Explicitly list any additional discovery, registration,
authorization or token origin. HTTPS is required, including for internal
services with certificates trusted by the host. HTTP redirects are not followed.

Without dynamic registration, configure secret references for a registered
client. Its callback is
`https://YOUR-SERVER/api/public/connectors/example-tools/callback`.
Client secrets never belong in YAML or browser responses.

Generic verification initializes MCP and lists accessible tools. It does not
invent an account identity when no provider identity endpoint exists. Atlassian,
GitHub and Salesforce retain their specific adapters and verification.

Changing a generic resource or OAuth settings requires reconnection. Refresh
also checks the original issuer and token endpoint. Disconnect removes local
credential access for every enrolled device.

## Migration and failures

Migration 051 replaces the three-provider database restrictions with server-ID
validation. Existing accounts, encrypted grants, revisions and generations are
preserved. Apply migrations with the new binary before adding another provider.
Older binaries cannot manage generic accounts; do not roll back after creating
them without first disconnecting/removing those accounts.

Authorization database failures stop inference with HTTP 503 and a retry hint.
Governance hooks return an explicit deny envelope. Look for
`authorization_unavailable` in logs; the next request evaluates fresh policy
after database access is restored.
